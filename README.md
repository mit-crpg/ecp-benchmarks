ECP Benchmarks
==============

This repository contains benchmarks for performance profiling of the OpenMC
and Shift Monte Carlo codes for ECP. Each directory contains a ``build-xml.py``
Python script which uses the OpenMC Python API to create XML input files for
OpenMC. The Python scripts and the XML files are included in this repository.
Each benchmark is derived from a subset (*e.g.*, fuel pins, assemblies) of the
full-core BEAVRS model with fresh UO2 fuel at HZP conditions. Each benchmark is
modeled in 2D with reflective boundary conditions along the axial dimension.

Model Descriptions
------------------

**fuel-pin**  
A single fuel pin with reflective boundary conditions (*i.e.*, an infinitely
repeating array of fuel pins). The default configuration is the BEAVRS fuel pin
with fresh 1.6% enriched UO2 fuel, but the script can be toggled to 2.4% or
3.1% enriched fuel.

**assembly**  
A single fuel assembly with reflective boundary conditions (*i.e.*, an infinitely
repeating lattice of fuel assemblies). The default configuration is the BEAVRS
assembly with fresh 1.6% enriched UO2 fuel with 24 water-filled control rod
guide tubes and a central air-filled instrument tube. However, the script can
be toggled to use any of the 20+ fuel assemblies in the BEAVRS model.

**2x2-periodic**  
A 2x2 fuel assembly colorset with periodic boundary conditions (*i.e.*, an
infinitely repeating lattice of the 2x2 assembly colorset). The default
configuration includes the BEAVRS assembly with fresh 1.6% enriched UO2 fuel
with 24 water-filled control rod guide tubes and a central air-filled
instrument tube, along with a 3.1% enriched fuel assembly with 20 burnable
poisons, four control rod guide tubes and a central instrument tube. However,
the script may be toggled to use any pair of the 20+ fuel assemblies in the
BEAVRS model.

**2x2-reflector**  
A 2x2 fuel assembly colorset surrounded by a water reflector. Reflective
boundary conditions are used on the top and left boundaries (adjacent to the
assemblies) and vacuum boundary conditions are used on the bottom and right
boundaries (adjacent to the reflector).  The default configuration includes
the BEAVRS assembly with fresh 1.6% enriched UO2 fuel with 24 water-filled
control rod guide tubes and a central air-filled instrument tube, along with a
3.1% enriched fuel assembly with 20 burnable poisons, four control rod guide
tubes and a central instrument tube. However, the script may be toggled to use
any pair of the 20+ fuel assemblies in the BEAVRS model.

Dependencies
------------

These scripts depend on the following Python packages:

* mit-crpg/openmc (develop branch)
* mit-crpg/PWR_benchmarks

Of particular note, The Python ``beavrs`` package must be installed from the
mit-crpg/PWR_benchmarks repository. This package may be installed with
``distutils`` as follows:

```bash
cd PWR_benchmarks/BEAVRS/openmc/inputs
python setup.py install
```
